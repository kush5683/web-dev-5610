**Project Objective:**
This project is a personal homepage created as part of the CS5610 Web Development course. The objective is to demonstrate proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by building a multi-page personal website that showcases your projects, resume, and other relevant information.

-   The page made with generative AI is the projects page (model used gpt-5-codex high with full agent access)
<br>Prompts:
<br>&emsp;1. ```Add a new page to the site, remember to update the nav elements on all other pages. The new pae should be called Projects. the top of the page should be the console creative element. Followed by the projects section on https://www.kushshah.net/#projects including the js to make the chips clickable and filters```
<br>&emsp;2. ```clicking on the chips should filter the projects```
<br>&emsp;3.```the projects should be removed if the filter does not apply```

Also made the design document with generative AI - supplied the requirements as described on canvas
