# Video Walkthrough Script

## Opening (0:00 – 0:15)
- Narration: “Hi! I’m Kush Shah. Welcome to a quick walkthrough of my personal homepage for CS5610.”
- On screen: Landing on `index.html` at the hero section.

## Homepage (0:15 – 1:00)
1. **Hero Photo Panel**
   - Narration: “The left panel shows a full-bleed hero photo with the site’s geometric grid layout.”
2. **About Panel**
   - Narration: “On the right, a vanilla JavaScript typewriter introduces my current role and studies.”
   - Fun fact: “This paragraph is typed one character at a time by `home-typewriter.js`. Clicking or pressing Enter instantly completes the story—no libraries required.”
3. **Signature Panel**
   - Narration: “The signature tile keeps my name front and center with a custom font and animated background accents.”
4. **Blank Accent Tile**
   - Narration: “The final tile creates a gradient accent that responds to hover, preserving the grid symmetry.”

## Projects Page (1:00 – 1:45)
1. **Creative Console Hero**
   - Narration: “The Projects page reuses the animated console from my GitHub profile to set the tone.”
2. **Filter Toolbar**
   - Narration: “Each chip is generated at runtime—click any combination to filter with an AND search.”
3. **Project Cards**
   - Narration: “Cards draw directly from `projects-data.js`, so updating the list means touching one JSON export.”
   - Fun fact: “When you filter, the grid is rebuilt with only matching cards. The script reuses the same tag buttons inside each card for consistency.”

## Resume Page (1:45 – 2:15)
- Narration: “The resume mirrors a two-by-two grid, highlighting Experience, Projects, Skills, and Education. Each panel uses descriptive class names that match the headings.”

## Design Document (2:15 – 2:40)
- Narration: “The design doc details personas, user stories, and mockups, including inline SVG wireframes for desktop and mobile.”

## Specialty Pages (2:40 – 3:00)
- Narration: “Extras include  a custom 404 page that follows the same visual language.”

## Closing (3:00 – 3:15)
- Narration: “Thanks for watching! Fork the repo to explore the vanilla JS patterns and dynamic project filters.”
